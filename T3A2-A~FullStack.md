## Client

'Little Parliament' and 'Our Store' a quiant little cafe in Rainbow Beach that also doubles up as a souvenir store.
## Purpose and Functionality

Brief - Create a website for a cafe and souvenir store called Little Parliament. This website should act as a landing page for customers who don't know that Little Parliament exists yet, it will showcase the menu, a little bit about the cafe as well as the products that are for sale in the store. As Little Parliament is located in Rainbow Beach, a secluded tourist town, guest to the town like to have an idea of what is available before arriving to the town. 

The landing page should give a good quick synopsis about the cafe, as well as being alluring enough to make the user explore more of the page. The next page would be an about us page and would showcase more detail about why the cafe exists as well as about the owners. The menu page would showcase the menu in a fun way, instead of just being a static image it will be an intereactive  page, that has a small description, image and price of all the items on the menu. The products page would be a static image page that has a list of all current items in stock, with the ability to add these items to a cart, purchase them and possible reserve them for pick-up. 

As this will be a website with the possiblity of becoming live, the owner of the cafe would like to be able to make changes without having to go through a developer. An admin panel where they can login and add, update and delete products and menu items as the need arises.
